# AppD Event Exporter

A tool to pull AppD events and store them outside of AppD.  This repo is meant to be a starting point for data extraction, and demonstrate the ease of use of the AppDynamics Events API, and intended to be extended and/or modified to fit your data storage requirements by providing an easy way to extract data with Python.

Currently, running the application after setting the account & api key, will result in a local JSON file based on your query, named `appd-data.json`.

## Usage

1. `mv accountName.txt.dist accountName.txt` and replace it with your Global Account Name
2. `mv apiKey.txt.dist apiKey.txt` and replace the contents with your Analytics API Key
3. Run `python3 run.py`
